# This script
# (1) Loads and resizes images
# (2) Finds interest points in those images                 (you code this)
# (3) Describes each interest point with a local feature    (you code this)
# (4) Finds matching features                               (you code this)
# (5) Visualizes the matches
# (6) Evaluates the matches based on ground truth correspondences

     1) Load stuff
     There are numerous other image sets in the supplementary data on the
     project web page. You can simply download images off the Internet, as
     well. However, the evaluation function at the bottom of this script will
     only work for three particular image pairs (unless you add ground truth
     annotations for other image pairs). It is suggested that you only work
     with the two Notre Dame images until you are satisfied with your
     implementation and ready to test on additional images. A single scale
     pipeline works fine for these two images (and will give you full credit
     for this project), but you will need local features at multiple scales to
     handle harder cases.

     If you want to add new images to test, create a new elif of the same format as those
     for notre_dame, mt_rushmore, etc. You do not need to set the eval_file variable unless
     you hand create a ground truth annotations. To run with your new images use
     python main.py -p <your file name>.

    :param file_name: string for which image pair to compute correspondence for

        The first three strings can be used as shortcuts to the
        data files we give you

        1. notre_dame
        2. mt_rushmore
